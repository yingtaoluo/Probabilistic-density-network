# Probabilistic-density-network 
Official Inplementation of "Probability-density-based deep learning paradigm for the fuzzy design of functional metastructures". ("A Quantum Inspired Probabilistic Learning Model for the Inverse Design of Meta-Structures" at NeurIPS 2020 ML4PS, https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05511) A probability-density-based neural network (PDN) is proposed for the multivalued on-demand design of materials. It excels in efficiency, accuracy, and output variety than other state-of-the-art deep learning models.
