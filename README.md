# Probabilistic-density-network  
It is an interdisciplinary research project submitted to Science Advances.  
A probability-density-based neural network (PDN) is proposed to address the multivalued relation between transmission and structure design that artificial neural network fails to tackle.  We show that this approach excels in efficiency, accuracy, and output variety than other state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as VAE/GAN with Bayes Optimization.
