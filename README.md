# Probabilistic-density-network   
A probability-density-based neural network (PDN) is proposed to address the multivalued relation between transmission and structure design that artificial neural network fails to tackle.  This appraoch is stable in optimization without time-consuming trial-and-error hyper-parameter tuning. It excels in efficiency, accuracy, and output variety than other state-of-the-art models, such as VAE/GAN with Bayes Optimization.
