# Probabilistic-density-network   
A probability-density-based neural network (PDN) is proposed for the multivalued on-demand design of materials. This quantum-inspired algorithm is stable in optimization without hyper-parameter tuning. It excels in efficiency, accuracy, and output variety than other state-of-the-art deep learning models.
## Prerequisite Environment (Recommended)
For neural network training: VS2017, CUDA, cudnn, python, numpy, pytorch, sklearn, matplotlib, scipy  
For numerical simulation: Matlab2017b, COMSOL5.4
